    <h2>Step by Step:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Rub the steak all over with a good lug of olive oil and a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper</li>
        <li>Add the steak to a hot pan, then cook for 6 minutes for medium-rare, or to your liking, turning every minute</li>
        <li>For more flavour, try one or a combination of the following… </li>
        <li>Halve a garlic clove and rub it over the steak every time you turn it</li>
        <li>Or create a herb brush by tying woody herbs like thyme or rosemary to the handle of a wooden spoon and brush it over the steak every minute or so</li>
        <li>Once cooked to your liking, rest the steak on a plate that can collect all the lovely juices for 2 minutes</li>
        <li>Carve with a nice sharp carving knife, then serve with the resting juices drizzled on top</li>
        <p>Everyone has their favourite ways to eat steak – with good old chips and a crisp, green salad, with pepper or horseradish sauces, or even a simple fresh salsa verde to cut right through it. Whatever you choose, we’re sure your lucky guest will love you for it.</p>
